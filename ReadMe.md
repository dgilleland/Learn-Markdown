# Learn Markdown

A **Markdown** file is simply a text file with an extension of `.md`. It provides a way to do "rich text" in a "plain text" format. That is, we write our content in "plain text" along with special characters/patterns to indicate **bold**, *italic* and other "formatting", and this markdown file can be automatically processed into HTML.

> **Note:** There are different "flavours" of Markdown, one of the popular ones being "GitHub Flavoured Markdown". They vary slightly in their features, but depending on how you choose to *render* the markdown, you can get whatever features you like in your environment.
